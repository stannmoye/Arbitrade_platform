# Current Trading Handoff — 2026-10-28

**Repository:** [stannmoye/Arbitrade_platform](https://github.com/stannmoye/Arbitrade_platform)  
**Canonical branch:** `main`  
**Latest main commit at handoff update:** `a51682da54b9e70434728de3e81fc088ce3f7148` (PR #205 squash merge)  
**Completed PR:** [#205 — automatic deposit-based tier qualification](https://github.com/stannmoye/Arbitrade_platform/pull/205)  
**Merged feature head:** `9d3e31ef521e62dd95447c1d1a867b80ad87cc8b`  
**Status:** PR #205 merged after all exact-head automated checks passed. Post-merge checks are running on main. No production migration or deployment has been run. The worker has only been tested against disposable MySQL/MariaDB databases; production readiness still requires post-merge CI to finish and deployment-time verification on the user's own server.

## Authoritative Trading tier policy

This policy is final and must be followed throughout the application:

- Customers must not browse, select, subscribe to, purchase, or activate Trading packages/tiers.
- Only authorized administrators configure tiers and their thresholds, duration, quota, schedule, allocation limits, risk controls and display settings.
- Tier entitlement is assigned automatically by the server only when cumulative, persisted qualifying credits manually submitted by an authorized administrator through the admin portal's **Credit Customer / wallet-credit form** meet an enabled tier's threshold.
- The admin portal's **Credit Customer / wallet-credit form is the sole qualifying source**. Only a positive customer credit manually submitted by an authorized administrator, explicitly classified as qualifying, and committed as `admin_manual_deposit_credit` qualifies. Customer/provider deposits, signup credits, imports, generic adjustments, profits, rewards, returned principal, bonuses, transfers, swaps, conversions and all other credit paths are excluded.
- Preserve the USD-minor-unit attribution and the currency rate, provider/source and timestamp used at credit time. Stale or unverifiable rates fail closed. A separately audited reversal linked to the original credit reverses that qualifying attribution; an ordinary debit does not.
- All active qualifying tiers contribute their configured daily opportunity quotas cumulatively. Never assign a fallback tier or quota.
- Customer-facing Trading UI/API may expose only a read-only eligibility result and total daily opportunity allowance. Do not expose tier names, thresholds, catalogue, subscription history, internal entitlement identifiers, or activation/management actions.
- Customer reads, login, refresh, popup views and client actions must not create entitlements, allocate capital, run worker lifecycle transitions or settle trades. The scheduled server worker owns automatic processing.
- Internal-ledger records, actual supported trade outcomes, transactional idempotency, auditability and reconciliation remain mandatory. Estimates are never realized results or ledger credits.

## Changes present in PR #205 at last inspection

- Replaced the customer package catalogue/activation experience with a read-only eligibility and combined allowance summary.
- Removed customer package listing/activation routes and legacy activation service references from the changed application code.
- Added explicit administrator classification of manual credits, qualifying USD attribution and conversion evidence, and audited deposit reversals. Policy clarification: only the admin portal's Credit Customer flow may create a qualifying Trading tier credit; all other deposit/credit paths are excluded.
- Added forward migration `0080_qualifying_admin_deposit_attribution.sql`; it preserves legacy subscription rows for audit but expires legacy customer-created entitlements. Migration history is retained and must not be deleted or rewritten to pretend old migrations never existed.
- Added/reconciled automatic tier entitlement creation, cumulative quota evaluation, worker-only lifecycle operations, API sanitization and policy contract tests.
- Updated `docs/TRADING_SYSTEM_SPECIFICATION.md` and `AGENTS.md`, removed the duplicate `docs/implementation-matrix.md`, and updated this handoff and the administrator menu guide to the authoritative policy.

## Admin-portal-only qualifying-credit clarification (2026-10-28)

- Reaffirmed the sole qualifying source: a positive credit manually submitted by an authorized administrator through the admin portal's **Credit Customer / wallet-credit form**, explicitly classified as `qualifying_deposit`, and committed to the customer's ledger as `admin_manual_deposit_credit`.
- Explicitly excluded customer/provider/payment-gateway deposits, signup credits, imported/opening balances, generic adjustments, profits, rewards, returned principal, bonuses, transfers, swaps, conversions and all other credit/deposit paths.
- Updated the canonical Trading specification, `AGENTS.md`, README, admin menu guide, master roadmap and this handoff. Updated the Credit Customer form copy to state the sole source and strengthened the Trading qualification contract tests to check admin-only route protection and signup-credit exclusion.
- The server-side implementation already gates qualifying attribution on the admin-only `adjustCustomerBalance` route, an explicit qualifying classification, a customer account, and the `admin_manual_deposit_credit` ledger type; tier reconciliation sums only that ledger type and linked audited reversals. The regression suite still needs to run on the exact final branch head.

## Required remaining work

1. Continue repository-wide searching on the PR branch for old customer Trading package selection, activation, manual assignment, wallet-balance qualification, repeat-purchase and cooldown flows. Distinguish obsolete Trading policy from unrelated Mining packages and immutable migration history.
2. Review all active Trading guides, admin menu documentation, roadmap, test contracts, router/API exports, components, service modules, settings, schema, migration journal and installer migration lists. Rewrite conflicting active docs; preserve historical audit records only when clearly historical and not presented as current instructions.
3. Verify migration `0079` against canonical `main` and ensure the settlement-timing repair and migration `0080`/ `0081` apply in the correct order. Do not merge the conflicting migration from PR #200 without explicit reconciliation.
4. Inspect the full PR #205 diff, especially the treatment of legacy entitlements and qualifying-credit/reversal attribution.
5. Run exact-final-SHA validation: `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile`, `pnpm check`, `pnpm test`, `pnpm build`, migration/installer validation, browser acceptance, Trading recovery checks and Mining regression checks. Report only results verified on the exact SHA.
6. Do not merge or deploy without authorization and successful validation.

## Latest documentation consistency increment

- Updated `docs/admin-portal-menu-guide.md` to remove manual customer package assignment from account creation/editing and Opportunity Engine guidance, and to document automatic tier qualification.
- The documentation-only commit created by that update is `52bfa0cf2d230883ef581edf14242ad921a7cedc`. The branch head moved; re-fetch the current PR head before any further write or validation.

## Credit-time USD conversion clarification (2026-10-28)

- Only qualifying credits submitted through the authorized admin portal Credit Customer form count toward Trading tier thresholds.
- For each qualifying credit, the server must fetch a live USD rate for the selected enabled wallet currency at credit time, persist the exact rate/provider/source timestamp and FX snapshot, and attribute the resulting USD minor units to that ledger credit. USD is 1:1; supported fiat uses Frankfurter/ECB with Open ExchangeRate API fallback and configured crypto/token IDs use CoinGecko. Do not fall back to editable registry rates; fail closed when a valid fresh API rate is unavailable.
- Admin customer views must show automatically assigned active Trading tiers and cumulative qualifying USD totals. Normal transfers are explicitly out of scope and must remain unchanged.
- Code changes for this clarification: `server/marketProviders.ts` adds `fetchCurrencyUsdRate`; `server/db.ts` calls it before the qualifying credit transaction, validates the currency configuration again inside the transaction, and records rate evidence in `fxRateSnapshots` and the qualifying ledger row. These changes are not yet validated by CI or a local test run.

## Durable automatic Trading tier qualification worker (2026-10-28)

- Added schema and migration `drizzle/0082_trading_tier_qualification_jobs.sql` for an indexed durable queue with unique source ledger IDs, processing leases, attempt counts, retry availability and dead-letter error storage; registered it in `drizzle/meta/_journal.json`.
- Qualifying administrator credits and qualifying-deposit reversals now enqueue a job atomically inside the same database transaction as the ledger entry. Non-qualifying credits and normal transfers are excluded.
- Added `runTradingTierQualificationWorkerCycle` in `server/db.ts`. It claims a bounded batch under row locks, reconciles each customer's cumulative USD eligibility, marks success, retries failures with exponential backoff, reclaims stale leases, and dead-letters after eight attempts.
- Registered the worker in `server/_core/index.ts` on a five-second unreferenced timer with an overlap guard. Idle processing uses indexed queue queries instead of scanning the full customer list.
- Added contract assertions for queue schema/migration, atomic enqueue, worker registration, bounded processing and retry behavior.
- Validation status: implementation changes are committed to the existing feature branch, but typecheck/build/tests and GitHub CI for the exact resulting head have not yet been verified. Do not claim production readiness until those checks pass and migration deployment is confirmed.

## Qualification queue migration reconciliation (2026-10-28)

- Follow-up inspection found an unjournaled duplicate migration file, `drizzle/0081_trading_tier_qualification_jobs.sql`, defining the same queue with incompatible column/status names. It was removed from the feature branch; the ordered journal's canonical queue migration remains `0082_trading_tier_qualification_jobs.sql`, matching `drizzle/schema.ts` and worker code.
- Added an idempotent `INSERT IGNORE` backfill to migration 0082 for qualifying admin credit/reversal ledger entries already persisted before the queue existed, and added a contract assertion for that backfill.
- Commits for this repair are on the existing PR branch. The exact latest commit is `a753e4d4ae9a28712a964e9e22f75a8b877c04c4`; GitHub Actions checks have started but are not yet complete.
- Still required before accepting this worker: review CI results for the exact head; run real disposable MySQL/MariaDB migration and concurrency tests for fresh schema, upgrade/backfill, duplicate enqueue/delivery, lease expiry/fencing, retries and tier/quota results. No production migration, deployment or merge has been performed.

## Disposable database verification added (2026-10-28)

- Added `scripts/trading-tier-qualification-db.integration.mjs` and `.github/workflows/trading-tier-qualification-db-integration.yml` to exercise the actual 0082 queue migration on isolated MySQL 8.4 and MariaDB 11.4 services.
- The database test seeds qualifying credit/reversal rows plus excluded rows, verifies migration backfill and unique-key duplicate prevention, exercises competing row-locked claims, confirms expired lease recovery and stale-lease fencing at database timestamp precision, and checks durable dead-letter status.
- The first CI run exposed a syntax error in the new test harness's URL validation; that harness error was corrected and the latest test commit is running again. Do not treat the earlier failed run as a product-code failure or as a passing result.
- The database suite verifies queue/migration mechanics, not the full application entitlement calculation against a complete production-shaped schema. Actual cumulative tier assignment/quota integration and exact-head full CI must still pass before this worker can be accepted.

- The MySQL 8.4 queue integration run passed on the then-current head. The first MariaDB 11.4 attempt failed before tests because the shared TCP root-password health check was incompatible with MariaDB's container defaults; the workflow now uses a MariaDB-native socket health check for that matrix leg. This is test-environment setup, not a migration assertion failure. The corrected exact-head run is pending.

## Real worker entitlement integration coverage (2026-10-28)

- Added a second disposable-MySQL integration leg that applies the complete guarded migration chain, imports the real `runTradingTierQualificationWorkerCycle`, and verifies actual automatic tier assignment at the USD 300 threshold (USD 100 + USD 300 tiers), cumulative daily quota of 10, and no USD 500 tier.
- The same test exercises concurrent worker cycles, stale processing lease recovery, transient failure retry, dead-letter transition on attempt eight, and reversal-driven revocation of the USD 300 tier while retaining the USD 100 tier and its quota.
- This stronger integration test is newly added and must pass on the exact final head before the worker is accepted. No production database has been touched.

- The first real-worker integration run showed both jobs remained pending because the test inserted `availableAt` at the current instant while the worker deliberately compares against a second-precision claim timestamp. The worker returned `claimed: 0`; this was a test-fixture scheduling race, not an entitlement or retry failure. The fixture now seeds immediate-test jobs as already due (10 seconds in the past) so it deterministically tests worker behavior rather than same-second timestamp rounding.

- Verification update: on commit `afad597ffcd4f2b459e83d0940b16a6fd10de978`, the real-worker MySQL integration passed. It confirmed two active tiers at USD 300, cumulative quota 10, no USD 500 tier, reversal-driven revocation back to quota 6, concurrent cycle idempotency, expired-lease recovery, retry, and dead-letter on attempt eight. The queue migration/backfill/concurrency matrix passed on both MySQL 8.4 and MariaDB 11.4. Exact-head typecheck/tests/build and remaining release/installer checks are still running; no merge or production migration has occurred.


## Admin-credit and FX end-to-end verification extension (2026-10-28)

- Expanded `scripts/trading-tier-qualification-worker.integration.ts` to call the real `adjustCustomerBalance` service against the disposable migrated MySQL database, rather than relying only on synthetic ledger/job rows.
- Added assertions that an explicitly qualifying USD admin credit writes the attributed ledger entry and durable queue job, while a non-qualifying admin credit is excluded from qualification and does not enqueue a job.
- Added a deterministic mocked Frankfurter response for a test-only non-USD wallet. The test deliberately sets the editable currency-registry rate to 99 and verifies that 100 native units are valued using the API-derived 0.5 USD rate (USD 50.00), and that provider/rate/source-time evidence is written to the FX snapshot store.
- The first run exposed a real schema mismatch: `fx_rate_snapshots.sourceDate` is limited to 16 characters, while the credit service attempted to store a full ISO timestamp in that column. Updated the stored summary field to fit the schema while retaining the complete source timestamp in `rawJson` and the qualifying ledger timestamp column.
- Exact-head integration, typecheck, test, build, installer and recovery checks are running on commit `e4baa336d4a0e2776537a04fe46e70badf8b4670`. The earlier failed run is not counted as passing. No production database has been touched; PR #205 remains unmerged.


- Follow-up exact-head run confirmed the source-date column-size issue was fixed, then exposed an overly strict test assertion: Frankfurter publishes a calendar date for fiat rates, while the full request/fetch timestamp is recorded separately. The integration assertion now checks the provider's calendar source date and the full `fetchedAt` timestamp independently. The exact latest head must pass the full suite before acceptance.

- Extended the actual admin-service integration coverage again to verify a partial reversal links to its original qualifying ledger entry, enqueues its own durable job, subtracts the recorded USD attribution, and rejects an over-reversal without creating a ledger entry/job. The exact latest head is `1527835cbb196b5287adc03c8027d15e1c65befd`; its full CI run is the acceptance gate.


## Latest acceptance and merge status — 2026-10-28

- PR #205 was squash-merged into `main` as `a51682da54b9e70434728de3e81fc088ce3f7148` after the exact feature-head checks were all green.
- Verified actual `adjustCustomerBalance` service integration on a disposable migrated MySQL database: qualifying USD credit, excluded non-qualifying credit, atomic durable queue creation, mocked API-derived non-USD rate and persisted FX evidence, linked partial reversal, over-reversal rejection, and worker processing.
- Verified worker behavior: cumulative tier/quota assignment, reversal-driven tier revocation, concurrent-cycle idempotency, stale-lease recovery, transient retry, and dead-letter after attempt eight.
- Verified queue migration/backfill/concurrency on disposable MySQL 8.4 and MariaDB 11.4. Type-check, unit tests, production build, browser checks, installer/migration recovery, application verification, and Trading recovery checks all passed on the exact feature head.
- Post-merge CI is running against the merge commit. Check the exact main SHA and all post-merge workflow results before deployment.
- Ordinary wallet-transfer implementation was not modified by this qualification change. The new integration test proves non-qualifying admin credits are excluded; do not describe this as a separate end-to-end transfer test.
- No production database has been touched. Do not begin the next worker until post-merge CI is green and this first worker has been verified after deployment.


## Task 2 — automatic opportunity scheduler and Trade lifecycle worker (2026-10-28)

- Started from the current main source at `e59eab4acd14f57125e8893fe9b30a14963753ce` on branch `feat/trading-opportunity-lifecycle-worker`; Task 1's merged tier qualification implementation was preserved.
- Replaced the per-cycle full `users` table scan with a bounded (default 100, maximum 250) round-robin query over currently active, automatically assigned Trading tier entitlements. The batch cursor is stored in `app_settings` and locked transactionally so concurrent server instances advance through eligible customer IDs; customers without an active auto-assigned tier are not scheduled.
- Added an entitlement lookup index in migration `0083_trading_opportunity_worker_indexes.sql` and registered it in the Drizzle schema and journal.
- Added a process-local overlap guard around the 30-second Trading cycle. Existing settlement reconciliation remains separate from actual settlement and cannot credit funds merely because a scheduled time elapsed.
- Added contract coverage for bounded entitlement selection, cursor locking/wrap-around, index registration and the cycle overlap guard.
- Validation status at this handoff update: source changes are committed to the Task 2 branch, but exact-head CI, type-check, tests, build, and installer/migration checks have not yet been verified. No production database or deployment has been touched.

## Current verified handoff — 2026-10-28 (post-merge)

- Canonical `main` is now at `d3f85084354f009c44236fb2e5c1dd0d0cf17435`; Task 2 was merged through [PR #207](https://github.com/stannmoye/Arbitrade_platform/pull/207).
- Post-merge GitHub Actions on that exact main SHA passed: application type-check/tests/build, Trading tier-qualification database integration, installer validation, Mining regression checks, and the two subsequent Blitz build runs.
- Task 2 implementation is merged: bounded round-robin scheduling (default batch 100, maximum 250), persisted/locked cursor, overlap guard, active auto-assigned entitlement filtering, indexed lookup migration `0083`, and lifecycle recovery coverage.
- Disposable-database integration and automated checks are verified; these results do not prove the worker has been exercised on the user's own production server.
- Remaining Stage 2 acceptance item: after the user's server is available, verify startup/migration `0083`, worker health and bounded scheduling, opportunity lifecycle recovery, and that settlement/reconciliation does not credit funds without confirmed outcomes. Also run a separate end-to-end ordinary wallet-transfer boundary test; the qualification integration only proves that non-qualifying credits are excluded.
- No production deployment or database migration has been performed by this work. The user has deferred Blitz/UI testing until later; keep PR #208 open and do not merge it as part of this stage.

## Progressive customer Trading package journey (2026-10-28)

- Customer Trading UI now presents a progressive, read-only journey: customers without an active tier see the first qualifying milestone; customers with an active tier see their highest active package and only the next enabled qualifying package.
- The customer eligibility API derives qualifying USD-minor attribution from the explicit admin manual credit/reversal ledger types and returns only the current tier, one next tier, the remaining qualifying amount, durations, and quota values. It does not expose the full package catalogue or any activation route.
- Updated the canonical Trading specification, root agent rules, administrator menu guide, and contract tests to reflect this limited progressive display while retaining the ban on customer browsing, selection, subscription, purchase, and activation.
- Validation remains pending for the exact feature branch head. No production deployment or database migration was performed for this UI change.

## Customer Trading package journey UI refinement (2026-10-28)

**Active PR:** [#208](https://github.com/stannmoye/Arbitrade_platform/pull/208) on `feature/customer-progressive-trading-tier-ui`. The branch is synchronized with current `main`; exact-head validation is pending.

- Removed any local-currency assumption from the customer milestone display. The qualification threshold is labelled as a USD equivalent because the authoritative ledger attribution is stored in USD minor units; explanatory copy makes clear that supported ledger-wallet credits are valued at the time an authorized administrator records a qualifying credit.
- Refined the read-only customer journey with theme-aware responsive cards, compact typography, current-package and next-milestone metrics, an accessible progress indicator, refresh/loading/error states, and reduced-motion support. The page does not expose a full catalogue or activation controls.
- Exact-head validation is pending for the UI refinement. No production deployment or database migration was performed.
